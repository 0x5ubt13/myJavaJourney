# Hello World!

In this folder I will be gathering all the basic Java resources and examples necessary to start coding our own project, acting as a huge cheatsheet. 

## Java Access Modifiers:
    1) Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
    2) Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
    3) Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
    4) Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.

## Java Non-access Modifiers:
    1) Static: modifier for creating class methods and variables.
    2) Final: modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.
    3) Abstract: modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.
    4 & 5) Synchronized and Volatile: modifiers, which are used for threads.

## Java methods:
    1) Void: returns nothing
    2) Int: returns an integer.
    3) Double: returns a floating point integer.
    4) Boolean: returns a boolean value (True or False).
    5) String: returns a string of text.

## Java Primitive Types:
| Name                     | Bits                     | Default value for fields |          Literals        |  
|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|   Boolean | 1-bit | 0 | True |
|   Byte | 8-bit | 0 | 100 |
| Char | single 16-bit Unicode character | '\u0000' | 'C' |
| Short | 16-bit | 0 | 1000 |
| Int | 32-bit | 0 | 10000 |
| Long | 64-bit | 0L | 100000 |
| Float | single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point | 0.0f | 1.5 |
| Double | double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point | 0.0d | 100.5 |
