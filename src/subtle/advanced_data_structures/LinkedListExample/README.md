A linked list is a doubly linked collection of elements. Each entry on the list also holds a reference to the previous and the next entry of the list.

If in doubt, always use Array lists. 
If we work in a gigantic list and we wanted to add or remove elements from the middle of it, a linked list would be a better option. If we only want to take elements off the list, an array list is quicker and uses less memory.
