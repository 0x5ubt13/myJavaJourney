# Collections in Java

```
   Iterable
      |
  Collection
  /   |   \ 
 Set List Queue
```

## Set 
- No duplicates
- Unordered

## List
- Duplicates allowed
- Order is significant

## Queue
- For FIFO operations
- Like a real life queue

## Map
- Does not actually extend the Collection interface
- Key-value pairs
- However, still considered part of the Collections framework
